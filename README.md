### Hi there, I'm Neil ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring developer, currently located in York, UK.

I'm always looking to use technologies to find solutions for problems as innovatively as I can manage.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building up some repos for my portfolio. I've been working with Ruby recently, and I've been finding some pretty cool applications for problems I, or people I work with, are coming across. Lately I've built:

- an app to collect and display all the nice things people say about you. This came after a chat with my line manager, who stressed the importance of looking at positive feedback. I thought it would be cool to have an app in which you could collect this.
- an app to collect anonymous feedback from nursery customers, and display it in a list in an admin panel for management to process. This built from the previous idea, and came from a conversation with my wife, who is a nursery manager and is always looking for improvements to service.
- an app called "Taskbuckets" that aims to help with productivityâ€”mainly the ability to prioritse tasks based on urgency and importance. I attended a time management webinar, and there seemed to be a niche for a simple app that you could configure to take care of urgent tasks and leave the less imprtant ones for later.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much back end as possible, after concentrating mainly on JS. I absolutely love CSS and always will :) I'm concentrating on Sinatra right now, as a lighter and faster alternative to Rails. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open-source projects, particularly Ruby/Rails based.
