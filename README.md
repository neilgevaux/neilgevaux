### Hi there, I'm Neil ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring developer, currently located in York, UK.

I'm always looking to use technologies to find solutions for problems as innovatively as I can manage.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building up some repos for my portfolio. I've been working with Ruby recently, and I've built:

- an app to collect and display all the nice things people say about you
- an app to collect anonlymous feedback for nursery customers, and display it in a list in an admin panel
- an app called "Taskbuckets" that aims to help with productivityâ€”mainly the ability to prioritse tasks based on urgency and importance

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much back end as possible, after concentrating mainly on JS. I absolutely love CSS and always will :)

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open-source projects, particularly Ruby/Rails based.
